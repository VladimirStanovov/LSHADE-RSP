### L-SHADE with rank-based selective pressure

My implementation of L-SHADE algorithm for solving the CEC 2017 competition on numerical optimization.
The algorithm is based on: R. Tanabe, A.S. Fukunaga, “Improving the search performance of SHADE using linear population size reduction”, Proceedings of the IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Cimputation, pp. 1658‒1665, 2014.
Uses modifications, described in: [10]	J. Brest, M.S. Maucec, B. Boskovic, “Single Objective Real-Parameter Optimization Algorithm jSO”, Proceedings of the IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Cimputation, pp. 1311‒1318, 2017.
As well as modified mutation strategy, which uses rank-based selective pressure.
